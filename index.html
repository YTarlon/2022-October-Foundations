        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>My top 5 favorite movies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hancock</li>
            <li>IRobot</li>
            <li>Bruce Almighty</li>
            <li>Liar Liar</li>

        <h2>Before web development</h2>
        <p>
            I was in school. It sucked.
        </p>
        <h2> After web development</h2>
        <p>
            I will have gotten one step closer to my dream job!

        <h1>Introducing the h1 element! It is 32px by default.</h1>
        <h2>And this is the slightly smaller h2 element. It is by default 24px.</h2>
        <h3>The h3 element is 18,72 by default.</h3>
        <h4>The h4 element is 16px.</h4>
        <h5>The h5 element is 13.28px.</h5>
        <h6>The h6 element is 10.72px.</h6> 
        <h1>style="font-size: 48px;"But wait! You can change these sizes! This h1 has been changed to 48px!</h1>
        <p>
            If you look closely you will see that the <strong>strong</strong> element and the <b>b</b> element (bold) look exactly the same on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hey look! We've got the same issue with the <em>em</em> and <i>i</i> elements!
